# Studyx _(Early development)_

> Study taken to the next level

## What is this?

Studyx _(patent pending)_ is an android application that
aims to make study planning easy.
The goal is to have an app which provides a class timetable,
exam timetable and study planner in one.

I also have ideas of adding a sort of plugin system for those
who may want to extend the app functionality, but that is a very
distant dream right now.

## Current stage

Right now we are at a very early alpha planning phase,
I hope to expand as time goes on though.
I am really new to android app development, so
this will definitely be a challenge. I can't wait!

## Why?

I have recently come to the realization
that my study timetable sucks and I really
need a way to improve my studying habits.

So what better way to improve them by creating
an app to do that for me!

I do understand that there are already many apps
out there that do exactly what my app is going to
do and many do it way better, but that is besides the point.
I hope to use this as a learning experience for myself
and a way of solving my own problem.
